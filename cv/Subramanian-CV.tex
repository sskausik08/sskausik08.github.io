\small{My research interests lie in the application of formal reasoning and programming languages techniques for verification and synthesis of networks. In recent times, networks have become increasingly complex and difficult to reason about and manage. My vision envisages developing techniques for verifiying and correctly programming networks based on intent, where operators should specify what the network should do, instead of how these intents are met.}

	\emph{44th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), Paris, France, 2017, (23\% acceptance rate)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A general and extensible approach to synthesize policy-compliant
		SDN forwarding tables for multi-tenant cloud settings using SMT solvers.
		Can support complex policies like reachability, waypoint traversal, path
		isolation and traffic engineering
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item A two phase synthesis algorithm for generating policy-compliant
		OSPF and BGP configurations which comply with high-level policies, even
		under failures. First, we use Genesis to synthesize a policy-compliant
		data plane, and then Zeppelin uses ILP solvers to generate OSPF and BGP
		configurations which converge to the policy-compliant data plane.

	\item \textbf{Detecting Network Load Violations for Distributed Control Planes} \\
	\underline{Kausik Subramanian}, Anubhavnidhi Abhashkumar, Loris D’Antoni, Aditya Akella and Yibo Zhu \\
	\emph{Under submission}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item By using an abstract representation of the control plane (ARC), we
		formulate a multi-node Mixed-Integer Linear Program which can be used to
		verify across machines if network links are overloaded (utilization
		exceeds capacity) under different failure scenarios. QARC models
		different routing protocols like OSPF and BGP and distributed load
		balancing strategies like ECMP/WCMP.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{D2R: Dataplane-Only Policy-Compliant Routing Under Failures} \\
	\underline{Kausik Subramanian}, Anubhavnidhi Abhashkumar, Loris D’Antoni, and Aditya Akella \\
	\emph{Under submission}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We design a network architecture where routing (computing active
		network paths) is done completely in the data plane using programmable
		P4 switches. Packets carry failure information and each switch can
		perform graph traversal algorithms completely in the data planes at near line 
		rates, and thus, avoiding losses incurred due to slow control planes.

		\item Worked on OpenR (https://github.com/facebook/openr), Facebook's internal routing platform. I implemented the 
		Netlink protocol for OpenR ($\sim$3k LoC) to interface with the Linux kernel to program routes and listen to link/address/route events 
		for protocol convergence.
